# makeFlow-Package
Documentation, troubleshooting, examples, announcements, and non-critical/intermediate updates regarding the makeFlow package originally posted on CRAN. Out of respect for the volunteers on the CRAN team, I'll update this page more frequently, with new versions released (at most) quarterly. Again, minor updates will be posted here as the .tar.gz source target file. Thanks for your feedback and recommendations. This is my first published package, so step-by-step we'll continue refining it. *If you're able to anonymize any work product made with the makeFlow package, I'd really appreciate you forwarding along an image with where/how it's being used. Cheers, Alex.      Krebs.AlexJ@gmail.com
