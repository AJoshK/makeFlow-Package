Troubleshooting & FAQ:

Thank you for your interest in the makeFlow package. This is my first published package, 
and I'm working hard to ensure it is successful in application. 
Your feedback is greatly appreciated as it helps to make this a more refined package. 



Problem:
I've downloaded the .tar.gz file (or installed from CRAN), and can load the package with library(makeFlow), 
but I get an error that it's impossible to find the makeFlow() function.

Response:
The quick solution is to use a high-level call from the package using the syntax of packageName+3colons+function(arguments) like follows:
makeFlow:::makeFlow(data = , classFields = )



Problem:
Error in classFields-- object not found.

Response:
Make sure you are using quotations to select your classFields, and that all elements are 
spelled the same as the corresponding column names (case sensitive).



Problem:
Palette "Set3" doesn't seem to support my inputs.

Response:
The most likely reason for this is too many unique categories over the extent of your specified columns. 
"Set3" allows for 12. Though the makeFlow() function should output a warning with the necessary number of colors, 
one can also use the function colorCount(data = , classFields = ). 
In the makeFlow() function, use the argument gateColors to manually specify colors-- I recommend checking out the 
R Color Cheatsheet, which can be found online.
